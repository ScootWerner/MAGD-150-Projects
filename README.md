# MAGD 150 Projects

This is a repository of projects that I have made in my MAGD 150 class.

## House
This is [House](https://github.com/ScootWerner/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab01_werner) made of very simplistic shapes.

## Earth
Then there is also [Earth](https://github.com/ScootWerner/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab02_Werners) and this is also made with simplistic shapes.

## Bubbles
[Bubbles](https://github.com/ScootWerner/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab03_Werners) was made as a screen saver template.

## Pizza
Cheese [Pizza](https://github.com/ScootWerner/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab04_Werner) the only pizza allowed and you can also reset your creation.

## TV
This [TV](https://github.com/ScootWerner/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab05_Werner) only turns on and it turns on an animation.

## Pac
You've seen him before but this [Pac-Man](https://github.com/ScootWerner/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab06_Werner)  continues to grow.

## Fall
Nothing beats this special season then a random bundle of [Leaves](https://github.com/ScootWerner/MAGD-150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab07_Werner) on the ground.
